# Portfolio Diversification with PCA

## Description
In this project, I attempt to use a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to create a diversified stock portfolio. A Monte Carlo simulation is subsequently performed on the components of the portfolio to determine the portfolio's performance. The weights of the stocks in the portfolio are then optimised and another simulation is run to observe the optimised performance.

## Packages used
sklearn for PCA and K-means clustering, numpy for Cholesky decomposition, scipy for optimisation, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualise.

## Usage
Feel free to download the project and experiment with the neural network, improve it, and create a pull request should you have any suggestions for improvement of the project.
